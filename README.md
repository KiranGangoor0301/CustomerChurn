# Customer Churn Prediction

![Customer Churn Prediction](churn_prediction.png)

## Overview

This CodeSoft project implements a customer churn prediction system, which utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze customer data and predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave) the service in the near future. By identifying potential churners, businesses can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Gathered comprehensive customer data, including usage patterns, demographics, and transaction history, for training and testing the prediction model.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implemented various classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks, to predict customer churn.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted relevant features from the dataset and performed preprocessing to enhance the model's accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Utilized metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the churn prediction model.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KiranGangoor0301/CustomerChurn.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Churn Prediction System:**
   ```
   python churn_prediction.py
   ```
